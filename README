A simple UNIX shell

========================================================

Requires flex and bison to build. The GNU Readline
library is required at runtime as well as compile time.

Supports:
  * foreground command execution
  * cd and exit shell builtins
  * script execution
      -> ./mysh script.sh
  * standard redirections
      -> these included: 2>/dev/null, 2>&1, 2<&1
  * the -c option
      -> ./mysh -c "echo hello world"
  * pipes
      -> echo I hate UNIX | sed s/hate/love/ | cowsay

               _____________
              < I love UNIX >
               -------------
                      \   ^__^
                       \  (oo)\_______
                          (__)\       )\/\
                              ||----w |
                              ||     ||

Doesn't support:
  * basically everything else :p

Just to make sure: DO NOT ACTUALLY USE THIS. This was a
project for me to learn about UNIX systems programming.
Creating a usable shell was a non-goal.
