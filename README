A simple UNIX shell

========================================================

Requires flex and bison to build.

Supports:
  * foreground command execution
  * the three basic redirections <, >, >>
      -> not supported: 2>, >&2, etc
  * the -c option
  * pipes
      -> echo I hate UNIX | sed s/hate/love/ | cowsay

                 _____________
                < I love UNIX >
                 -------------
                        \   ^__^
                         \  (oo)\_______
                            (__)\       )\/\
                                ||----w |
                                ||     ||

Just to make sure: DO NOT ACTUALLY USE THIS. This was a
project for me to learn about UNIX systems programming.
Creating a usable shell was a non-goal.
