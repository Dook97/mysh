A simple UNIX shell

========================================================

Final program for the UNIX/Linux Programming in C
course at MFF UK during winter semester 23/24.

Requires flex and bison to build.

This is a project via which I learn about UNIX systems
programming. Please don't try to seriously use this.
You would be disappointed.
