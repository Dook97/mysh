A simple UNIX shell

========================================================

Final program for the UNIX/Linux Programming in C
course at MFF UK during winter semester 23/24.

Requires flex and bison to build.

Supports:
  * foreground command execution
  * the three basic redirections <, >, >>
      -> not supported: 2>, >&2, etc
  * semicolons to separate commands
  * rudimentary quoting like so: "..."
      -> no support for escaping though
  * pipes
      -> echo I hate UNIX | sed "s/hate/♥/" | cowsay

             ____________
            < I ♥ UNIX >
             ------------
                    \   ^__^
                     \  (oo)\_______
                        (__)\       )\/\
                            ||----w |
                            ||     ||
